# Resources for researchers  (r4r)

This repository shares resources from WIPO's innovation economics team with the research community in the broad field of innovation economics. The resources are shared under the MIT license, which basically means you can use any of them _"as is"_ as far as you credit the source.

If you improve any of these resources or have constructive comments to any of it, please send us the feedback. We are aslo developing a contribution policy to be added here soon.
